# Write the function bestQuiz(a), which takes a rectangular 2d list of numbers that represents a gradebook, 
# where each column represents a quiz, and each row represents a student, 
# and each value represents that student's score on that quiz (except -1 indicates the student did not take the quiz).
#  For example:
#   a = [ [ 88,  80, 91 ],
#         [ 68, 100, -1 ]
#       ]
# This list indicates that student0 scored 88 on quiz0, 80 on quiz1, and 91 on quiz2. 
# Also, student1 scored 68 on quiz0, 100 on quiz1, and did not take quiz2.
#  The function returns the quiz with the highest average. In this case, quiz0 average is 78, 
# quiz1 average is 90, and quiz2 average is 91 (since we ignore the -1).
#  Thus, quiz2 is the best, and so the function returns 2 in this case. 
# You are not responsible for malformed input, except you should return None if there are no quizzes. 
# Also, resolve ties in favor of the lower quiz number. Here is a test function for you:
